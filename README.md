Repo that contains code used throughout COMP90055 Research

Note that the code displayed throughout this notebook is a bit messy. It is has not been uploaded for the viewer to rerun the code, but rather to show what work was done. All notebooks excluding the data1 and data2 notebooks were hosted on Google Colab and made use of their GPUs.

Brief file descriptions:
- RES50_UL: Encoder-decoder reserach using ResNet50 bckbone. DeepLabV3+ and UNET architectures used
- Xception_UL: Encoder-decoder reserach using Xception bckbone. DeepLabV3+ and UNET architectures used
- RES50_XG2: Feature extraction using ResNet50 into XG boosted trees using 
- Xception_XG2(1): Feature extraction using ResNet50 into XG boosted trees using
- data1 : Data methods for creating first dataset used in the thesis 
- data2 : Data methods for creating second dataset used in the thesis
- funtion_collection: Series of helper functions used throughout thesis
